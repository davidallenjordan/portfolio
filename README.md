# David Allen-Jordan Portfolio

Just go look at the real deal at [davidallenjordan.com](https://davidallenjordan.com)

This is my portfolio created to show employers some of my projects so they give me a job (that means you!). 


## Tools/Methods used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Sass
- Responsive design
- Sketch
- Ally

## Tasks:
- Design a site to show projects, skills, and a little bit about my personality
- Create a wireframe with Sketch
- Maintain responsiveness down to 320px
- Adhere to accessibility best practices and use semantic HTML

## Challenges/Improvements: 
- Make it more modern, I don't know if I will ever be satisfied with it (**Update** - I did it!)
- Add more JavaScript effects
- Add a blog post section! Maybe I'll write a blog post about adding a blog post section. Whoa
